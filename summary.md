# Peregrine Falcon SDK: Summary

## One Framework, Every Platform

The Peregrine Falcon SDK is a next-generation, open-source framework for building beautiful, high-performance applications that target any platform from a single codebase. Built on the solid foundation of the Dart language and its powerful runtime, Peregrine Falcon is designed to be approachable, portable, and productive.

Our vision is to provide a unified development experience for building applications for the web, desktop, and command-line interfaces (CLIs) without compromising on platform-specific conventions or performance.

## Core Principles

*   **Unified Development Experience:** Write your application once and deploy it everywhere. Peregrine Falcon provides a consistent set of tools, libraries, and patterns for all target platforms.
*   **Platform-Specific Fidelity:** While the core of your application is shared, Peregrine Falcon allows you to embrace the unique strengths and conventions of each platform. We believe that "write once, run anywhere" should not mean "write once, look the same everywhere."
*   **Developer-First Ergonomics:** We are committed to providing a development experience that is both enjoyable and productive. This includes a rich set of tools, a comprehensive documentation, and a supportive community.

## Target Platforms

Peregrine Falcon is designed to be a true "all-in-one" solution for application development. Our target platforms include:

*   **Web:** Leveraging the power of the Vue ecosystem, Peregrine Falcon provides a reactive and component-based model for building modern web applications. We aim to be a strong competitor to frameworks like Jaspr, offering a more familiar and intuitive development experience for those coming from the JavaScript world.
*   **Desktop:** Building on the success of Flutter, Peregrine Falcon provides a robust and feature-rich solution for building native desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux. We will provide a component library that feels at home on each platform.
*   **CLI/TUI:** Inspired by the elegance and power of the Charm Bracelet ecosystem, Peregrine Falcon provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for building beautiful and interactive command-line and text-based user interfaces.
