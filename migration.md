# Peregrine Falcon SDK: Migration Guide

This document provides guidance on how to migrate existing applications to the Peregrine Falcon SDK.

## Comparison to Existing Frameworks

The Peregrine Falcon SDK is designed to be a compelling alternative to existing frameworks and libraries. Here is a high-level comparison of the Peregrine Falcon SDK to some of the most popular frameworks in our target domains:

| Framework          | Primary Platform | Language    | Core Concepts                               |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Peregrine Falcon** | All              | Dart        | Component-based, reactive, cross-platform   |
| Flutter            | Mobile, Desktop  | Dart        | Widgets, reactive UI                        |
| Vue.js             | Web              | JavaScript  | Components, reactive data binding           |
| Charm Bracelet     | CLI/TUI          | Go          | The Elm Architecture, declarative UI        |

## Migrating from Flutter

Since the desktop implementation of the Peregrine Falcon SDK is built on top of Flutter, migrating from an existing Flutter application should be a relatively straightforward process.

1.  **Replace `flutter` with `peregrine-flutter`:** Start by replacing the `flutter` dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file with `peregrine-flutter`.
2.  **Adapt your widget tree:** You will need to adapt your existing widget tree to use the components and APIs provided by the Peregrine Falcon SDK. In many cases, you will be able to continue using your existing Flutter widgets with minimal changes.
3.  **Embrace the core concepts:** Take advantage of the core concepts of the Peregrine Falcon SDK, such as the unified component model and state management solution.

## Migrating from Vue.js

Migrating from Vue.js to the Peregrine Falcon SDK will require a more significant effort, as you will be switching from JavaScript to Dart. However, the conceptual overlap between Vue.js and the Peregrine Falcon SDK should make the process manageable.

1.  **Learn Dart:** The first step is to familiarize yourself with the Dart programming language. The official Dart documentation is a great place to start.
2.  **Map Vue components to Peregrine components:** The component models of Vue.js and the Peregrine Falcon SDK are very similar. You should be able to map your existing Vue components to Peregrine components with relative ease.
3.  **Adopt Peregrine's state management:** Replace your existing state management solution (e.g., Vuex) with the one provided by the Peregrine Falcon SDK.

## Migrating from Charm Bracelet

Migrating from Charm Bracelet to the Peregrine Falcon SDK will also require a language switch from Go to Dart. The key to a successful migration will be to understand how the core concepts of Charm Bracelet map to the Peregrine Falcon SDK.

1.  **Learn Dart:** As with migrating from Vue.js, the first step is to learn Dart.
2.  **Adapt "The Elm Architecture":** Charm Bracelet is built on "The Elm Architecture" (TEA). You will need to adapt this model to the state management solution provided by the Peregrine Falcon SDK.
3.  **Use Peregrine's TUI components:** Replace your existing TUI components with the ones provided by the `peregrine-charm` package.

## Potential Challenges

*   **Platform-Specific APIs:** When migrating from a platform-specific framework, you may need to find alternatives for platform-specific APIs that are not available in the Peregrine Falcon SDK.
*   **Dependency Management:** You will need to find Dart equivalents for any JavaScript or Go dependencies that you are currently using.
*   **Build System:** You will need to adapt your existing build process to use the build system provided by the Peregrine Falcon SDK.
*   **Community and Ecosystem:** As a new framework, the Peregrine Falcon SDK will have a smaller community and ecosystem than more established frameworks. You may need to build some of your own tools and libraries.
