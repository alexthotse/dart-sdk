# Peregrine Falcon SDK: Implementation Details

## High-Level Architecture

The Peregrine Falcon SDK is designed with a layered architecture to maximize code reuse while allowing for platform-specific implementations.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|                 Application Layer                   |
| (Your Peregrine Falcon application code)            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|        Platform-Specific Abstraction Layer          |
|                                                     |
| +-----------------+ +-----------------+ +-----------+ |
| | peregrine-vue   | | peregrine-flutter| | peregrine-charm | |
| | (Web)           | | (Desktop)     | | (CLI/TUI) | |
| +-----------------+ +-----------------+ +-----------+ |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|                  Core Framework Layer               |
|                                                     |
|      +------------------+ +-------------------+      |
|      | peregrine-core   | | peregrine-ui      |      |
|      +------------------+ +-------------------+      |

|                    Dart SDK Layer                   |
|                                                     |
|  +----------+ +-----------+ +----------+ +---------+  |
|  | Dart VM  | |  dart2js  | | dart2wasm| |   pub   |  |
|  +----------+ +-----------+ +----------+ +---------+  |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```

*   **Application Layer:** This is where your application code lives. You will primarily interact with the APIs provided by the Core Framework Layer and the Platform-Specific Abstraction Layer.
*   **Platform-Specific Abstraction Layer:** This layer contains the platform-specific implementations for web, desktop, and CLI/TUI. These packages will adapt the core concepts of the framework to the conventions and capabilities of each platform.
*   **Core Framework Layer:** This layer contains the core logic of the framework, including the component model, state management, routing, and other cross-platform concerns.
*   **Dart SDK Layer:** The foundation of the Peregrine Falcon SDK is the Dart SDK. We leverage the Dart VM for native execution, `dart2js` and `dart2wasm` for web compilation, and `pub` for package management.

## Leveraging the Dart SDK

The Peregrine Falcon SDK is not a replacement for the Dart SDK, but rather a set of libraries and tools that build on top of it.

*   **Dart VM:** For desktop and CLI/TUI applications, we will use the Dart VM for its high performance and JIT/AOT compilation capabilities.
*   **`dart2js` and `dart2wasm`:** For web applications, we will use `dart2js` and `dart2wasm` to compile Dart code to highly optimized JavaScript and WebAssembly.
*   **`pub`:** We will use `pub` for package management, allowing developers to easily share and consume packages from the pub.dev repository.
*   **Core Libraries:** We will make extensive use of the core Dart libraries, such as `dart:async`, `dart:collection`, and `dart:convert`.

## Proposed Directory Structure

The Peregrine Falcon SDK will be developed as a monorepo, with each of the core components living in its own package.

## Core Libraries and APIs

The Peregrine Falcon SDK will be composed of a set of modular libraries that can be used independently or together.

*   **`peregrine-core`:** This package will contain the core, platform-agnostic logic of the framework. This includes:
    *   A component model for building UIs.
    *   A state management solution.
    *   A dependency injection system.
*   **`peregrine-ui`:** This package will provide a set of core UI components and primitives that can be used across all platforms. These components will be designed to be easily customizable and extensible.
*   **`peregrine-router`:** This package will provide a routing solution for navigating between different screens or pages in your application.
*   **`peregrine-vue`:** This package will provide the web implementation of the framework, with a focus on a Vue-like developer experience. It will include a DOM renderer and a set of web-specific components.
*   **`peregrine-flutter`:** This package will provide the desktop implementation of the framework, leveraging the power of the Flutter engine. It will include a set of desktop-specific components and integrations.
*   **`peregrine-charm`:** This package will provide the CLI/TUI implementation of the framework, with a focus on a Charm-like developer experience. It will include a set of components for building beautiful and interactive command-line interfaces.
