# Peregrine Falcon SDK: Roadmap

This document outlines the proposed roadmap for the development of the Peregrine Falcon SDK. The roadmap is divided into three phases, each with a specific set of goals and milestones.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Web (6-9 months)

The first phase of our roadmap is focused on building the core foundation of the framework and delivering a best-in-class experience for web development.

*   **Key Features:**
    *   Core component model and state management (`peregrine-core`).
    *   Reactive and component-based web framework (`peregrine-vue`).
    *   Basic routing (`peregrine-router`).
    *   Initial set of UI components (`peregrine-ui`).
*   **Milestones:**
    *   **Month 1-2:** Develop the core component model and state management in `peregrine-core`.
    *   **Month 3-4:** Alpha release of `peregrine-vue`, including a DOM renderer and basic component support.
    *   **Month 5-6:** Beta release of `peregrine-vue`, with a focus on stability and performance.
    *   **Month 7-9:** Stable release of `peregrine-vue` and the core packages.

## Phase 2: Desktop and CLI/TUI (6-9 months)

The second phase of our roadmap is focused on expanding the reach of the Peregrine Falcon SDK to the desktop and command-line.

*   **Key Features:**
    *   Native desktop framework for Windows, macOS, and Linux (`peregrine-flutter`).
    *   CLI/TUI framework for building interactive command-line applications (`peregrine-charm`).
    *   Deeper integration with the underlying operating systems.
*   **Milestones:**
    *   **Month 1-3:** Alpha release of `peregrine-flutter`, with support for basic desktop UI.
    *   **Month 4-6:** Alpha release of `peregrine-charm`, with a focus on a rich set of TUI components.
    *   **Month 7-9:** Stable release of `peregrine-flutter` and `peregrine-charm`.

## Phase 3: Community and Ecosystem (Ongoing)

The third phase of our roadmap is focused on growing the community and ecosystem around the Peregrine Falcon SDK.

*   **Key Features:**
    *   Comprehensive documentation and tutorials.
    *   A vibrant and supportive community.
    *   A rich ecosystem of third-party packages and tools.
*   **Milestones:**
    *   Launch a dedicated website with interactive tutorials and documentation.
    *   Create a community forum and Discord server.
    *   Establish a grant program to support the development of third-party packages.

## Future Features and Enhancements

Beyond the initial roadmap, we have a number of ideas for future features and enhancements, including:

*   **Mobile Support:** A dedicated implementation for building native mobile applications for iOS and Android.
*   **Visual Editor:** A visual editor for building UIs with the Peregrine Falcon SDK.
*   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** A solution for rendering web applications on the server for improved performance and SEO.
*   **Static Site Generation (SSG):** A tool for generating static websites from your Peregrine Falcon application.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** A built-in solution for internationalizing your applications.
